Example: you can\r\n  migrate your MSSQL to PostgreSQL, without losing the structure,\r\nincluding not only the original schema, the constraints, and of course,\r\nthe data it self, which is converted to respective data-type.\r\n- Copy one database schema to another.\r\n- Move data from one database to another.\r\n- Compare two databases.\r\n\r\n## Downloading and running DBTransfer\r\nFor now you, to run DBTransfer, you need to check out the project, and\r\ncompile it, using:\r\n```\r\n$ mvn package\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create a ./target/dbtransfer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n\r\nAfter this, you have to run the tool, using:\r\n```\r\njava -jar dbtransfer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  _**dbtransfer.properties**_\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou have to create a properties file, like the ones in the examples.\r\n\r\n## What needs to be done.. right away!\r\nImprove the output, ~~and enable Maven~~ on the project. Feel free to help\r\nout!\r\n\r\n## Sponsors\r\nThis project had the invaluable help of a tool, DBVisualizer, which help\r\nus test everything and connect to any database. DBVisualizer uses JDBC, the same framework as DBTransfer, so it provides a nice way to validate database metadata and testing database connections to use in the properties file.\r\n\r\nOur friends at DBVisualizer were very kind to provide to all the\r\ncontributers, a valid DBVisualzer Pro license. Thank you for your\r\nsupport!\r\n\r\nDBVisualizer - http://www.dbvis.com\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
